# 010Editor_Addons

Templates and Scripts for use on game files in 010 Editor (editor by Sweetscape.com)

## Introduction

010 Editor is an editor with powerful functions and user extensibility, including
extensibility for the hex editor and binary file parsing.

File formats related to retrogaming (i.e. patch files, backup memory files, etc.) may
be more easily read if extensions are made for these file formats, and this is what I
set out to do with the work contained in this repository.

Any files in tis repository are free to use, if you have 010 Editor.
Pull Requests are welcome for updates and/or new Templates/Scripts


### Templates

Templates for 010 Editor are used to help the user to navigate binary file structures,
by indicating what information is stored in the header, and to be able to browse the
data in the body of the files.

Templates in this repository:

| Name | File type | Function |
|------|-----------|----------|
| IPS.bt | IPS Patch File | Marks out each patch section's location, size and data with colour-coding |
